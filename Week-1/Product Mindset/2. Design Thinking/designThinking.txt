Consider 4 roads that intersects as shown in th figure. Let all road be a one-way road. The road number is displayed in the diagram
for better explaining here. So when user wants to go from road 1 to road 3 its straight forward he has to wait for signal to get 
green and move on. And also same applies for people in road 3 to road 1. If someone wants to go from road 3 to road 2 he can go 
without waiting for the signal and cross the divider join road 2. If he want to go to road 4, first he needs to go to road 1 cross 
the divider than join road 4. 
This approaches is little time consuming but better efficient when traffic is high since this is more systematic. Even padestian lane 
is provided to cross when signal turns red.
